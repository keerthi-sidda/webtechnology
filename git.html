<h1>Version Control System</h1>
<p class="p">Version control systems are a category of software tools that help a software team manage changes to source code over time.
 Version control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database. 
If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members.
Version control software is an essential part of the every-day of the modern software team's professional practices. 
Individual software developers who are accustomed to working with a capable version control system in their teams typically recognize the incredible value version control also gives them even on small solo projects. 
Once accustomed to the powerful benefits of version control systems, many developers wouldn't consider working without it even for non-software projects.
</p>
<h3>Use of Version Control System:</h3>
<ul>
<li>A repository: It can be thought as a database of changes. It contains all the edits and historical versions (snapshots) of the project.</li>
<li>Copy of Work (sometimes called as checkout): It is the personal copy of all the files in a project. You can edit to this copy, without affecting the work of others and you can finally commit your changes to a repository when you are done making your changes.</li>
</ul>
<h1>GIT and GITHUB</h1>
<h3>GIT:</h3>
<p class="p">Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.</p><br>
<h3>GITHUB:</h3>
<p class="p">GitHub is a Git repository hosting service, but it adds many of its own features. While Git is a command line tool, GitHub provides a Web-based graphical interface. It also provides access control and several collaboration features, such as a wikis and basic task management tools for every project.</p>
<h1>GIT Commands</h1>
<h3>1.Fork</h3>
<p>A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.</p>
<h3>2.Commit</h3>
<p>The git commit command captures a snapshot of the project's currently staged changes. Committed snapshots can be thought of as “safe” versions of a project—Git will never change them unless you explicitly ask it to. Using the "git commit" command only saves a new commit object in the local Git repository.</h2>
<h3>3.Push</h3>
<p>The push command can be considered as a tool to transfer commits between local and remote repositories.It is used to publish new local commits on a remote server.</p>
